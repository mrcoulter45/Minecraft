## Mods
To run Optifine and Forge/WorldEdit at the same time, run Optifine installer first, then Forge installer second. 

### Optifine
- Just double click 'mods/OptiFine_1.12_HD_U_C3.jar' to install it. Then, the 1.12 game version in the Minecraft launch menu will be updated to the Optifine version.

### World Edit
- Run 'forge-installer/forge-1.12-14.21.1.2387-installer-win.exe' then run the 1.12 Forge game version in the launcher. You will then have Optifine and Forge running simultaneously.
